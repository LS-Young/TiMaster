Motivation  

Student getting busier and busier with their studies. They need not only to sort out the knowledge they are studying, but also manage their time well, so that they do not have to stay up late every night and then they can have more time to go for the activities they like and enjoy their campus life. 

The existing apps like Nusnextbus, websites like Luminus, NusMods and Edurec can all provide a timetable thing, but they are all isolated from each other that make time management everyday a bit inconvenient.
